The Bazingalabs STACKY concept will enable you to build your electronics project quicker, cheaper and easier than ever before! 
Build your electronics project in 3 simple steps: 

1. Choose the functionality you need for your project. We'll have the following STACKY boards soon:

	* [PROGER](/proger.html): will enable you to program any STACKY board using a simple USB connection and will allow you to see what all of the different boards in STACKY are saying to each other LIVE!

	* [ROGER](/roger.html): add wireless functionality to STACKY.

	* TYRONE: a quadcopter platform for brushless motors. Incorporates control systems which makes the platform accept simple commands like "hover, go forward, turn, strafe, speed" Make STACKY fly!

	* BATTYBOY: provides energy to your STACKY. Includes a LiPo battery, integrated charging circuit and battery protection.

	* SUNSPARK: provide solar energy from a solar panel to your STACKY and/or charge the BATTYBOY battery board with solar 	energy!
	
	* BRAINIAL: a processing board. This is where you tell all the other boards in STACKY what you want them to do!
	
	* RIGGME: want to develop your own board? The RIGGME will make development easy!


2. Stack them on top of one another

3. Hook your STACKY up to your PC or Mac's USB-port and program away!
