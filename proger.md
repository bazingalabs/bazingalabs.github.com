## Description

The PROGER is a tool that enables you to program any Bazinga labs STACKY board. With the debug option it is also very useful for debugging an entire stack of boards as it enables you to look at all of the communication between boards (sniffing the I2C line). The PROGER has a USB connection and interfaces to the well known Arduino IDE, making programming and debugging of boards very easy.
