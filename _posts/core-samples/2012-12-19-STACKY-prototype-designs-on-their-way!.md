Bazingalabs just sent out a couple of new STACKY board designs. 



We'll soon be testing our designs for the following boards:


--> BATTYBOYv3. This board is essentially a LiPo battery. Features are: deep discharge protection,
discharge current limit (short protection), charge from USB, charge through STACKY, overcharge protection. 


--> ROGERv3: wireless communication. STACKY compatible as well as XBEE compatible! 


--> PROGERv3: allows you to hook up any STACKY configuration to your computer through USB, sniff all
STACKY board-to-board communications realtime and program any board in the STACKY config. All of this
without the need of resetting, disconnecting or flipping any switches on any STACKY board!


--> MITCHv3: short for "MITCH THE SWITCH". This board will allow you to switch high powers.
Combined with a ROGERv3 board that would make a wireless switch!
